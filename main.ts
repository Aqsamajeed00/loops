// EXAMPLE!!
// Imagine you have to catch a bus in 5 minutes make a typescript while loop program for it

let minuteinBus = 5
while(minuteinBus > 0) {

//While Loop
let i : number = 0;      // In this example the loop will continue to run as long as the condition 'i < 5' is true. The loop will stop when 'i' become equal to or greater than 5...
while (i < 5 ){               //while loop condition p chlta hy 
        console.log(i);

//For Loop...
